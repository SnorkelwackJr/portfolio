      <h1>Sea Turtle Overview</h1>

      <p>Sea turtles are large, air-breathing reptiles that inhabit tropical
        and subtropical seas throughout the world. Their shells consist of an
        upper part (carapace) and a lower section (plastron). Hard scales (or
        scutes) cover all but the leatherback, and the number and arrangement
        of these scutes can be used to determine the species.</p>


      <p>Sea turtles come in many different sizes, shapes and colors. The
        olive ridley is usually less than 100 pounds, while the leatherback
        typically ranges from 650 to 1,300 pounds! The upper shell, or
        carapace, of each sea turtle species ranges in length, color, shape
        and arrangement of scales.</p>


      <p>Sea turtles do not have teeth, but their jaws have modified “beaks”
        suited to their particular diet. They do not have visible ears but have
        eardrums covered by skin. They hear best at low frequencies, and their
        sense of smell is excellent. Their vision underwater is good, but they
        are nearsighted out of water. Their streamlined bodies and large
        flippers make them remarkably adapted to life at sea. However, sea
        turtles maintain close ties to land.</p>


      <p>Females must come ashore to lay their eggs in the sand; therefore, all
        sea turtles begin their lives as tiny hatchlings on land. Research on
        marine turtles has uncovered many facts about these ancient creatures.
        Most of this research has been focused on nesting females and hatchlings
        emerging from the nest, largely because they are the easiest to find and
        study.</p>


      <p>Thousands of sea turtles around the world have been tagged to help
        collect information about their growth rates, reproductive cycles and
        migration routes. After decades of studying sea turtles, much has been
        learned. However, many mysteries still remain.</p>

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>There are 7 species of sea turtles.</li>
        <li>Leatherback sea turtles can travel more than 10,000 miles every
          year.</li>
        <li>When it’s time to lay their eggs, female sea turtles  return to the
          same nesting grounds where they were born.</li>
        <li>During incubation, sex is determined by the temperature of the
          surrounding environment. Warm temperatures tend to produce more female
          hatchlings, whereas cooler temps result in males.</li>
        <li>Sea turtles have glands that help to empty excess salt from their
          eyes, making it appear as though they’re crying, but not to worry,
          they’re just doing some spring cleaning.</li>
        <li>Since they don’t have to return to land to lay eggs, males almost
          never leave the ocean. This can make it difficult to keep track of
          population numbers.</li>
        <li>It is estimated that only one hatchling in a thousand will make it
          to adulthood. Whether it’s the treacherous journey from nest to ocean
          or the predatory dangers of the open sea, it’s a cruel, cruel world
          out there for these youngsters.</li>
